This project contains a folder for each task, in which a BASH file is contained, as well as LOG and ERROR files and related files.

In total there are 6 tasks in addition to a main file that is responsible for navigating to the appropriate task according to the user's choice.
The user runs the MAIN file with a flag for the task he wants to run and sends parameters accordingly.

For example for task 2 the user would enter the command:
./mainVeteran.sh -2 i.txt "."
